# To-Do List

The To-Do List Application is a simple console-based program that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add tasks, view all tasks, delete tasks, and save/load tasks from a file. Save/load feature is done by converting code to Json format file and reading it when the app is activated to restore your task list.
